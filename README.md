### **Question 1.**
*CPU type*: atomic,minor,hpi

*Frequency*: 1GHz

*Components Voltage*: 3.3V

*CPU voltage*:1,2V

*cache*:fixed line sized 64 bytes, private L1 caches and a shared L2 cache (using minorCPU) 

*CPU frequency*: 4 GHz (default)

*Number of cores*:1 by default

*Number of memory ranks per channel*:2GB by default

*Memory*: 2GB by default

We can change the operation frequency by searching for the command:

    self.clk_domain = SrcClockDomain(clock="1GHz",voltage_domain=self.voltage_domain)

and changing "1GHz" to some other value

        or

change the command    

    parser.add_argument("--cpu-freq", type=str, default="4GHz")

### Question 2.

*sim_seconds*: Number of seconds simulated

*sim_ints*: Number of executed instructions during simulation (commited by the CPU)

*host_inst_rate*: Number of instructions that would be executed per second (performance of gem5)

### Question 3.

*total instructions*: 5028

*system.cpu_cluster.l2.overall_misses::.cpu_cluster.cpus.inst*: 332                       
( number of overall misses )

*system.cpu_cluster.cpus.dcache.overall_misses::total*: 179                       
( number of overall misses )

*system.cpu_cluster.cpus.icache.overall_misses::total*: 332                       
( number of overall misses )

### Question 4.

Some in-order CPUs used by gem5 are:

***AtomicSimpleCPU***

The AtomicSimpleCPU is the version of SimpleCPU that uses atomic memory accesses. It uses the latency estimates from the atomic accesses to estimate overall cache access time. The AtomicSimpleCPU is derived from BaseSimpleCPU, and implements functions to read and write memory, and also to tick, which defines what happens every CPU cycle. It defines the port that is used to hook up to memory, and connects the CPU to the cache.

***TimingSimpleCPU***

The TimingSimpleCPU is the version of SimpleCPU that uses timing memory accesses. It stalls on cache accesses and waits for the memory system to respond prior to proceeding. Like the AtomicSimpleCPU, the TimingSimpleCPU is also derived from BaseSimpleCPU, and implements the same set of functions. It defines the port that is used to hook up to memory, and connects the CPU to the cache. It also defines the necessary functions for handling the response from memory to the accesses sent out

***MinorCPU***

Minor is an in-order processor model with a fixed pipeline but configurable data structures and execute behaviour. It is intended to be used to model processors with strict in-order execution behaviour and allows visualisation of an instructionâ€™s position in the pipeline through the MinorTrace/minorview.py format/tool. The intention is to provide a framework for micro-architecturally correlating the model with a particular, chosen processor with similar capabilities.The model isn't currently capable of multithreading but there are THREAD comments in key places where stage data needs to be arrayed to support multithreading.MinorCPU has a fixed four-stage in-order execution pipeline, while it has adjustable data structures and execution behavior. It can therefore be configured at the micro-architecture level to model a specific processor. The four-stage pipeline includes fetching lines, decomposition into macro-ops, decomposition of macro-ops into micro-ops and execute. 

***HPI (High-Performance In-order) CPU***

This model is based on the Arm architecture and we call it HPI. The HPI CPU timing model is configured to represent a modern in-order Armv8-A application. The HPI CPU pipeline uses the same four-stage model as the MinorCPU mentioned earlier. 


#### a)

First,we simulate our program without changing any parameters:

> * ./build/ARM/gem5.opt -d program_result_minor configs/example/se.py --cpu-type=MinorCPU --caches -c program_arm
***MinorCPU:***
sim_seconds                                  0.000036                       # Number of seconds simulated

> * ./build/ARM/gem5.opt -d program_result_timingsimple configs/example/se.py --cpu type=TimingSimpleCPU --caches -c program_arm

***TimingSimpleCPU:***
sim_seconds                                  0.000043                       # Number of seconds simulated

We observe that MinorCPU has a significantly less execution time.

#### b. 

Now we change the frequency of the simulation decreasing it to 500MHz using the commands:
